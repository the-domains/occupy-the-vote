We're fans of democracy. True representative democracy, for all.

However, we all feel let down by politicians and understand what it feels like not to have a voice.

Why vote? Why bother? It's all the same. They're all on the make. One war or the next, what's the difference? Labour took us to war, Tories carried it on. Bombs, bombs and more bombs. Terror, fear, terror and more fear.

We have banks not schools, war not healthcare - and voting doesn't change anything....

If that's how you feel (and you're not alone), that your vote doesn't count and you can't make a difference....

We'd like to persuade you otherwise. Please use your vote.

Your voice counts. We can make a change. Be the change you want to see in the world.
